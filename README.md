This program will ask the user to pick a difficulty mode (Easy, Medium, or Hard), then it will generate a random number for the player to guess from.
It will keep track of how many guesses the user makes, and will let them know if their guess is higher or lower than the correct number. When the user
guesses correctly, they will have the option to play again afterwards.
